#### Insights
In the Clothing section of the company 

- The South Region has the highest quantity of 24,298 units in sales making it also the region with the highest Sum of Revenue of N927,820
- The East Region has the second highest quantity of 20,361 units in sales making it the next region with the sum of Revenue at N485,925
- The North Region is followed with quanity of 12,402 units with total Revenue of N387,000
- The West Region has the least quantity of 11,400 units with toatl Revenue of N300,345 

With the Total revenue for both periods at  N2m an analysis of products performance highlights that the Hats emerged as the highest seling item  with a 23% Sales over the other 6 products while the jackets ranked the lowest in sales. This could indicate that hats have a stronger appealor are priced strategically to generate higher sales. whereas the jasckets would most definetely need additional attention in terms of marketing, pricing, or even design adjustment. The month of January also within the 2 year periods was the most active sales period which could also be due to factors Post holiday shopping , new year bonuses, promotions and discounting of items.

#### Recommendations 
- Re evaluate marketing strategies: Allocate more of their marketinf budget towards hats items to keep it runningbut also invest in targeted campaigns for other items to raise their visibilty
- Cross selling : they can use the popularity of Hats to encoourage the purchase of other items by pairing them at a discounted rate.
- Focus on the regions not performing so well and bring in more campaigns of their goods with more targeted adverts and marketing
